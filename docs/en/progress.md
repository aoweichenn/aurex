# Current Progress

Version: 0.1.2
Stage: M2 language-core-no-std

## Overall Status

The repository is now in the M2 stage. M2 does not continue the abandoned M1
track. It recenters the project on the language core by removing the standard
library and M1 system examples from the active tree.

M1 was discarded because too many concerns expanded at once: standard library
APIs, host support, build-tool examples, selfhost experiments, resource rules,
and language syntax. The result made it hard to tell whether a failure came from
the language, the library, or the tooling. M2 keeps only the active C++ Stage0
compiler, Aurex IR, LLVM backend, and self-contained language samples as the
valid baseline.

The current tree has no `std/` or `selfhost/` directory. Historical std/selfhost
notes are design input only, not current progress.

## Completed

- CLI support for `--check`, `--dump-*`, `--emit=*`, `--opt-level`, `-I`, `-o`,
  `--clang`, and `--clang-arg`.
- Driver support for file IO, module loading, pipeline orchestration, temporary
  LLVM IR generation, and clang invocation.
- Import resolution through the importer directory and explicit `-I` paths.
- Handwritten lexer/parser with ID-backed AST and dump paths for tokens, AST,
  modules, checked summaries, Aurex IR, and LLVM IR.
- Semantic analysis for types, symbols, functions, ABI names, structs, enums,
  generics, expression types, visibility, and pattern matching.
- Ordinary root-module `fn main` entry points.
- Typed Aurex IR, IR verifier, conservative pass pipeline, LLVM lowering, and
  native asm/object/executable output through clang.

## Removed From The Active Track

- The `std/` source tree.
- Host C support and implicit support-source linking.
- Driver std lookup and automatic import-path injection.
- `--stdlib`, `--std-backend`, and `--no-stdlib`.
- Install rules for `share/aurex/std`.
- std/M1/system/build-tool examples and std-specific tests.
- std-name resource-semantics hardcodes.
- The previous selfhost / Stage1 / AIR snapshot implementation in this tree.

These can return only after core syntax, module/package rules, `unsafe`,
slices/strings, and generic constraints are stable. Owned resource libraries
also require the deferred resource-semantics design.

## Quality Gates

Use:

```sh
tools/run_tests.sh
tools/bench.py
```

The test suite covers lexer/parser behavior, CLI/driver behavior, positive and
negative samples, modules, visibility, generics, functions, methods, pattern
matching, error handling, type-system diagnostics, IR lowering, IR verification,
LLVM lowering, native execution, and installed compiler execution.

## M2 Gaps

- Block statements and block expressions still use different parser paths.
- Const initializers do not cover all pure scalar operations.
- There is no compound assignment.
- Top-level items and struct fields still default to public.
- Enum syntax still behaves more like explicit C enums than ergonomic ADTs.
- Generics have no `where`, trait, or capability predicates.
- The M1 language-level `noncopy` / `move` MVP has been removed from the M2
  baseline. M2 keeps ordinary value semantics plus the current array-containing
  value restrictions; copy/drop/borrow/ownership are deferred to a later
  resource-semantics design.
- Raw pointers currently carry FFI, receiver, address, and temporary-borrow
  roles that should eventually be separated by safe references and `unsafe`.

## Current Conclusion

M2 should freeze the basic language surface before restoring std, selfhost, or
build-tool work. The active compiler can already validate language-core samples
and produce native output, but the next work should be syntax and semantic
stabilization rather than expanding library surface area.
